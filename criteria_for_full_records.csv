","There are some standard ranges that we don't use, e.g., WID high zs--do we need to abide by these if going to HD?; also TOZ exception for classed together mono series, not sure how we could tell this as part of this process. (I don't see the point carving out an exception for high Zs for HD. Does the need to check for classed together series necessitate a manual step in the workflow? That could be a reason to try and eliminate those exceptions.)"
